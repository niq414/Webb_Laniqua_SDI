    that both the Parrot and bag of seed are not eaten in the process

Potential Solutions:

The man could take the cat in the boat and allow the Parrot to fly alongside the boat to get to the other side once they are on the other side the parrot could ride in the boat with the man to go back and get the bag of seed and then travel back to the other side with the seed in the boat and the Parrot flying along side.

2. The man could leave the bag of seed and the cat and take the bird to the other side of the river then come back for the bag of seed and take it to a the area that is midpoint and go back for the cat and take him to the other side and get the bird and take him to where the bag of seed is leave him there get the seed and take the seed to the other side where the cat is then go get the bird and take him to the other side with the cat and the bag of seed.
